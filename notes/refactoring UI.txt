# Refactoring UI

## Scratch
- design the features

- design with no details
  use paper, why: you cannot apply details on it

- move fast on your ideas
  forget about details and design fast your idea paper

- only necessary
  dont design every single page

- design -> code -> desing ...
  design simple feature -> go to code -> catch problems -> design it ...

- only necessary feature
  ignore 'nice-to-have' ideais

- language
  choose between formal or casual language
  
 - limit your choices
   don't waste your time by choosing small things

- define systems
  shades with 8-10 colors

- system for all
  font size, font weight, line height, color, margin, padding, width, box shadows, border radius, border width, opacity...
  other low-level design decision
  system when you're creating, don't define it at once
